## Description

Submission for Front-End Web Development Bootcamp Week 1 Challenge:

An adaptation of code provided in order to meet accessibility standards and optimise the site for search enginges.

The project was built to practice completing tasks expected of a web designer, in this case: to refactor the code for a marketing agency's website to meet accessibility standards and achieve SEO.

The adapted code includes alt text for all the images used, and use of semantic elements to provide additional information regarding the different elements on the page. The CSS had been refactored and simplified, and the structure of the html elements improved.

This project was a great way to put into practice the content learnt in the first week of the Bootcamp, and learn about semantic elements and code refactoring. It was also a good opportunity to practice agile project management.

I realised retrospectively that I was editing the code directly from the main branch, and had forgotten to create a separate branch for edits, this is something I should improve on next time to ensure good habits are developed.
